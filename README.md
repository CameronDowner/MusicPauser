# MusicPauser - Pause music based on the level of ambient sound

My friend, Danny, reached out to me with a problem he was experiencing.

**Problem:** When he was woodworking and listening to music he would often miss the best part of the song because of a loud powertool he's using

**Solution:** An app that listens to your ambient sound & pauses whatever your listening whenever it goes above a given threshold.

# How it works

You initially set the 'baseline' ambient noise you're happy to listen to & then set the 'pause threshold' based as a proportion of that ambient sound.

Start playing your music & the app should pause when it hears a loud noise!
